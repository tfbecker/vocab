| Mercosur | South American trade bloc: Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela. Attempts at 'South American EU' but lacks shared currency, politics, education standards. |  |
| Bolivia - Landlocked | Lost 250 miles of coastline to Chile in 1879 War of the Pacific. Never recovered. Among poorest Latin countries. Won't sell gas to Chile despite having 3rd largest reserves. |  |
| Mexico - Geography Limits | Sierra Madre mountains dominate east and west. Desert north (buffer with USA). Jungle south. Poor soil on western slopes. Capital Mexico City: 20 million in Valley of Mexico. |  |
| Mexican-American War (1846-48) | Mexico lost Texas, California, New Mexico, Arizona to USA. Half of its territory ceded. No serious movement to reclaim, but Hispanics will be majority in these states by mid-century. |  |
| Drug Cartel Geography | US closed Colombia air/sea routes in 1990s. Cartels created land route through Central America and Mexico. Now Mexican gangs have paramilitary wings as well-armed as state. |  |
| Aconcagua Mountain | 22,843 feet. Highest point in Western Hemisphere. In the Andes, Argentina. Waters tumbling down provide hydroelectric power for Andean nations. |  |
| Brazil - Geography | 1/3 of South America. 27 federal states. Bigger than 28 EU countries combined. 1/3 is jungle (Amazon). Grand Escarpment blocks coast-interior connection. |  |
| Grand Escarpment - Brazil | Massive cliff dominating Brazil's coast. Must build roads up and over it to connect coastal cities. Limits trade and national unity. |  |
| Amazon Geography Problem | Second-longest river (after Nile). Muddy banks, surrounding land difficult to build on. Rainforest soil too poor for sustained farming. Slash-and-burn fails within years. |  |
| River Plate (Rio de la Plata) | Empties into Atlantic in Argentina (not Brazil). For centuries, traders moved goods to Buenos Aires rather than up Brazil's escarpment. Brazil's 7 largest ports < New Orleans. |  |
| Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) | Argentina's shale formation, size of Belgium. Could supply 150 years of energy. Located in Patagonia. Requires massive foreign investment Argentina struggles to attract. |  |
| Falklands/Malvinas War (1982) | Argentina invaded British-held islands. UK task force recaptured them 8 weeks later. Led to fall of Argentine military dictatorship. All Argentine schoolchildren taught to draw the islands. |  |
| BRICS | Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa. Fashionable grouping but not meaningful political/geographic unit. If letters hadn't spelled a word, theory wouldn't have caught on. |  |
| Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) | Spain and Portugal agreed to divide all lands discovered outside Europe. Pope approved. Drew line through lands they knew nothing about. Led to colonization that wiped out vast majority of indigenous inhabitants. |  |
| Simón Bolívar | Venezuelan leader of South American independence movements (early 1800s). Bolivia named after him. 'Bolivarian' ideology = anti-US, loosely socialist/nationalist. Still invoked by left-leaning Latin leaders. |  |
| War of the Pacific (1879) | Bolivia lost 250 miles of coastline to Chile. Landlocked ever since. Never recovered economically. Refuses to sell natural gas to Chile despite Chile's need. Wounds not healed 140+ years later. |  |
| Roosevelt Corollary (1904) | 'Monroe reloaded.' Teddy Roosevelt claimed US right to militarily intervene whenever it chose in Western Hemisphere. US used force in Latin America ~50 times between 1890 and Cold War end. |  |
| Panama Canal (1914) | 50 miles long, US-built, saved 8,000-mile journey around South America. Controlled by Panama since 1999. Neutral international waterway safeguarded by US and Panama navies. China's problem: relies on American goodwill. |  |
| Nicaragua Grand Canal | $50 billion Chinese-funded project. Longer, wider, deeper than Panama Canal. Can take bigger ships including Chinese naval vessels. Splits country in two. About national interests, not commercial profit. |  |
| The Andes | 4,500 miles long, parallel to Pacific coast. Longest continuous mountain chain in the world. Snow-capped entire length. Mostly impassable. Cuts western South America off from east. |  |
| Pearl Harbor (1941) | Japan response to US oil embargo after Indo-China invasion. Led to US Pacific war. Japan swept through SE Asia: Burma, Singapore, Philippines, plus already held Taiwan (1895), Korea (1910), Manchuria (1932). |  |
| Hiroshima & Nagasaki (1945) | US chose nuclear option over amphibious invasion of Japan (massive casualties predicted). Geography played role: fanatical defenders in mountainous terrain. Changed warfare forever. |  |
| Japan Post-War Constitution | Imposed by USA. No army/navy/air force - only 'Self-Defense Forces'. Defense spending limited to 1% of GDP. 32,000 US troops still stationed in Japan (as of book writing). |  |
| Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands | Japanese name: Senkaku. Chinese name: Diaoyu. Controlled by Japan, claimed by China. Part of Ryukyu Island chain. Potential gas/oil fields. Overlapping air defense zones. Flashpoint for conflict. |  |
| Kuril Islands | North of Hokkaido. Japan lost to Soviet Union in WWII. Still Russian-controlled. ~19,000 inhabitants. Rich fishing grounds. Ensures frosty Russia-Japan relations but less strategic than China disputes. |  |
| Korea as 'Hermit Kingdom' | Nickname earned in 18th century. Centuries of invasion: Mongols, Ming China, Manchurians, Japanese. Korea tried isolating itself to be left alone. Not successful - Japan annexed 1910. |  |
| Japan's 2015 'Destroyer' | Actually aircraft carrier (forbidden by 1945 surrender terms). As big as WWII carriers. Can be adapted for fixed-wing aircraft. Defense minister: 'not thinking of using it as aircraft carrier.' |  |
| South Korea Military | ROK economy 80x stronger than North. Population 2x larger. Modern navy built over 30 decades. Dependent on foreign energy - must protect sea lanes. Still has issues with Japan over occupation. |  |
| Korean Division (1945) | 38th parallel chosen by two US junior officers (incl. Dean Rusk) with National Geographic map during all-night meeting. No Koreans present. North: Soviet-backed Communist. South: US-backed dictatorship. Division meant to be temporary. |  |
| Korean War (1950-53) | North invaded South June 1950. US/UN pushed back almost to China border. China entered, pushed back to 38th parallel. 3 years fighting, ~4 million deaths. Ended in truce (not treaty) - technically still at war. |  |
| North Korea (DPRK) | ~25 million people. 'Democratic People's Republic of Korea' - actually hereditary Communist monarchy. Juche philosophy: fierce nationalism + self-reliance. 150,000+ political prisoners. 84% of imports/exports with China. |  |
| Seoul's Vulnerability | 35 miles from DMZ. Half of South Korea's 50 million live in greater Seoul region. 10,000 North Korean artillery pieces in hills above DMZ. Estimated 500,000 rounds could hit city in first hour of war. |  |
| Japan - Geography | 127 million people on 4 main islands + 6,848 smaller islands. 3/4 of land uninhabitable (mountains). Only 13% suitable for farming. 120 miles from Eurasian mainland - never successfully invaded. Tokyo: 39 million (world's largest mega-city). |  |
| Kamikaze Origin | 1300s: Mongols tried to invade Japan after sweeping through China/Korea. Storm wrecked their fleet. Japanese called it 'Divine Wind' (kamikaze). Term reused for WWII suicide pilots. |  |
| Japan Annexation of Korea (1910-45) | Banned Korean language and history teaching. Forced Shinto shrine worship. Cultural destruction. Legacy still poisons Japan-Korea relations today. |  |
| Japan's Resource Problem | Few natural resources: little coal, almost no oil, limited gas, scarce metals. Drove 1930s-40s expansion into China, SE Asia. Still world's largest natural gas importer, 3rd largest oil importer. |  |
| Iran - Geography | 78 million people, majority Farsi-speaking. Bigger than France, Germany, UK combined. Two mountain ranges: Zagros (900 miles along Iraq/Turkey borders) and Elburz (along Caspian Sea). Third-largest oil reserves. |  |
| Iran - Military Defense | Mountains on 3 sides, swamps/water on 4th. Mongols (1219-21) were last to make progress. US in 2003: 'We do deserts, not mountains.' Iran-Iraq War 1980-88: Iraq never made it off swamp plains. ~1 million dead. |  |
| Strait of Hormuz | Only 21 miles wide at narrowest. ~20% of world's daily oil passes through. Iran's trump card: can close it for months, spike global oil prices. Key reason countries pressure Israel not to strike Iran. |  |
| Saudi-Iran Cold War | Core Middle East rivalry. Saudi: Sunni, 28M people, richer (oil developed). Iran: Shia, 78M people, larger military. Each wants to dominate region. Each champions its version of Islam. Iraq was buffer under Saddam. |  |
| Turkey - Geography | 75 million people, 98% Muslim. Less than 5% of territory in Europe (west of Bosporus). Controls Black Sea exit through Bosporus (<1 mile wide). If closed, Russian Black Sea Fleet trapped. |  |
| Atatürk (Mustafa Kemal) | Father of modern Turkey, died 1938. Only Turkish WWI general with enhanced reputation. Introduced: Western legal codes, Latin alphabet (replacing Arabic), Gregorian calendar, women's vote. Banned fez, Islamic institutions. |  |
| Turkey's Strategic Position | Borders three seas. Trade bridge: Europe ↔ Middle East ↔ Caucasus ↔ Central Asia. NATO member. Controls Bosporus + Dardanelles = Russian naval chokepoint. Never fully accepted as European. |  |
| Lebanon - Creation | French created it post-WWI for Arab Christians. Named after nearby mountains. Only census: 1932 (demographics too sensitive). Shia now majority. Hezbollah controls southern suburbs, backed by Iran. |  |
| Lebanese Civil War (1975-90) | 15 years of fighting between confessional groups. Military would fall apart in new civil war - soldiers would join local militias. Country unified only on maps. |  |
| Assad Family - Syria | Alawite clan (~12% of population) ruling Sunni majority (70%). Father Hafez took power 1970 coup. Son Bashar rules now. Hama Massacre 1982: ~30,000 Sunnis killed crushing Muslim Brotherhood uprising. |  |
| Alawites | Originally called Nusayris - rebranded as 'followers of Ali' for Islamic credentials. Many Sunnis don't consider them Muslim. French put them in police/military - became power base. Now rule Syria. |  |
| Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) | Grew from Al Qaeda in Iraq late 2000s. Split from Al Qaeda. ISIL = Islamic State in Levant. Arabic 'Levant' = Al Sham, hence ISIS. Proclaimed caliphate 2014. Captured territory where Al Qaeda only captured headlines. |  |
| Gaza | 25 miles long, 7.5 miles wide. 1.8 million people. Penned in by Israel/Egypt security barriers on 3 sides, sea on 4th. One of world's most densely populated areas. Cannot build near Israeli border. |  |
| West Bank Geography | 7x size of Gaza but landlocked. Mountain ridge runs north-south. Controls coastal plain where 70% of Israelis live. 10 miles to Tel Aviv at narrowest. Any army on ridge could cut Israel in two. |  |
| Six-Day War (1967) | Israel won control of Jerusalem, West Bank, Gaza, Golan Heights. Settlements remain in West Bank. Gaza evacuated 2005. Jerusalem: Israel's 'eternal, indivisible capital' - third holiest site in Islam. |  |
| Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916) | British diplomat Mark Sykes drew line from Haifa to Kirkuk. Secret agreement with French diplomat François Georges-Picot to divide Ottoman territories. North: France. South: Britain. Created artificial borders still contested today. |  |
| Ottoman Empire (1299-1922) | Ruled from Istanbul. At height: from gates of Vienna across Anatolia to Indian Ocean. Included modern Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Israel/Palestine, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, parts of Iran. Divided into 'Vilayets' based on tribal areas. |  |
| Sunni vs Shia Split | Dates to 632 CE after Prophet Muhammad's death. Dispute over succession. Sunni: chose successor by Arab tribal tradition (~85% of Muslims). Shia: 'Party of Ali' - believed Ali (Muhammad's son-in-law) should lead. Ali and sons assassinated. |  |
| Iraq's Three Regions | Mosul (north): Kurdish. Baghdad (center): Sunni Arab. Basra (south): Shia Arab. Ottomans ruled as three separate vilayets. British combined them into one 'Iraq' - creating permanent instability. |  |
| Kurdistan | Not a recognized state but identifiable region. Iraqi Kurdistan: 5 million Kurds in Irbil, Sulaymaniyah, Dahuk provinces. Al-Anfal campaign 1988: up to 100,000 Kurds killed by Saddam including gas attacks. |  |
| Treaty of Sèvres (1920) | Post-WWI treaty that promised Kurds their own state. Never implemented. Kurdish independence dream still unrealized 100+ years later. |  |
| Jordan (Hashemite Kingdom) | Created by British post-WWI. Capital Amman was 'dusty little town'. Hashemites not originally from area - from Mecca region. Population now majority Palestinian (fled 1967). Plus 1M Iraqi/Syrian refugees. |  |
| Saudi Arabia | Named after Saud family who rule it. British promised Arabian Peninsula to both Saud and Hashemite tribes (who fought each other). Solution: drew lines, gave each family a territory. |  |
| Transcontinental Railroad (1869) | Connected East to West coast. Reduced cross-country travel from several hazardous months to one week. Enabled continental economic integration. |  |
| Spanish-American War (1898) | USA routed Spain, gained: Cuba (controls Florida Straits), Puerto Rico, Guam (vital Pacific base), Philippines. Secured Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico approaches. |  |
| Hawaii Annexation (1898) | Same year as Spanish-American War. Protected approaches to US west coast. Critical Pacific strategic position. |  |
| Panama Canal Treaty (1903) | USA leased exclusive rights to Panama Canal. Enabled ships to transit Atlantic-Pacific without rounding South America. Trade boomed. |  |
| Destroyers for Bases Agreement (1940) | Britain traded almost all Western Hemisphere naval bases for 50 US warships. Ended British global naval power. USA gained strategic bases across Atlantic. |  |
| Marshall Plan (1948-51) | US-funded reconstruction of post-WWII Europe. Ensured Soviet Union wouldn't reach Atlantic coast. Kept American troops in Europe ('Doughboys didn't go home'). |  |
| NATO Formation (1949) | North Atlantic Treaty Organization. USA led formation and effectively commands Western military. Military commander is always American. Civilian head rotates among allies. |  |
| Suez Crisis (1956) | USA pressured UK and France to cease Egypt occupation. Demonstrated NATO countries cannot hold strategic policy without asking Washington first. UK/France lost Middle East influence. |  |
| Strait of Malacca | Narrowest point: 1.7 miles. 12 million barrels of oil pass daily to China/Asia. Controlled by Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore - all pro-American. Key US strategic advantage over China. |  |
| US-Taiwan Treaty | USA pledged to defend Taiwan if China invades. Red lines for China: formal US recognition of Taiwan, or Taiwan declaration of independence. Could trigger invasion/war. |  |
| USA - Three Geographic Regions | East: Coastal Plain + Appalachian Mountains. Center: Great Plains + Mississippi Basin. West: Rocky Mountains + Desert + Sierra Nevada + Pacific coast. 3,000 miles coast to coast. |  |
| Louisiana Purchase (1803) | USA bought entire Louisiana Territory from France for $15 million. Doubled US size. Gave control of Mississippi basin - the greatest inland water transport route in the world. |  |
| Original Thirteen Colonies | Established 1607-1732 (Georgia last). Stretched from Massachusetts to Georgia. Population: ~2.5 million. Bounded by Atlantic Ocean (east) and Appalachian Mountains (west). |  |
| Declaration of Independence | July 4, 1776. Revolutionary War: 1775-1783. Declared 'all men are created equal' (while many founders owned slaves). |  |
| Monroe Doctrine (1823) | Warning to European powers: No more colonization in Western Hemisphere. Any lost territory cannot be reclaimed. 'Or else.' Named after President James Monroe. |  |
| Transcontinental Treaty (1819) | Spain ceded Florida to USA. Also accepted US jurisdiction in far west above 42nd parallel. USA reached Pacific Ocean. Secretary John Quincy Adams called it 'a great epoch in our history.' |  |
| Texas Revolution (1835-36) | 20,000 white Protestant settlers vs. Mexican Catholics. Texas became independent, joined Union 1845. Mexican-American War 1846-48 crushed Mexico, established Rio Grande border. |  |
| Homestead Act (1862) | Awarded 160 acres of federal land to anyone who farmed it for 5 years and paid small fee. Drew massive European immigration to build continental empire. |  |
| Alaska Purchase (1867) | Bought from Russia for $7.2 million (2 cents/acre). Called 'Seward's Folly' after Secretary of State William Seward. Vindicated by 1896 gold rush, later oil reserves. |  |
| Russia - Key Facts | Population: 144M. GDP: $2.2T. GDP/capita: $15,077 (63rd world). Size: 6M sq miles, 11 time zones. World's largest country. 75% of territory in Asia, but 78% of population in European Russia |  |
| North European Plain - Russia's Weakness | Flat corridor from France to Urals. Only 300 miles wide at Poland, expands to 2,000+ miles at Russian border. Invasion route: Poles (1605), Swedes (1708), Napoleon (1812), Germans (1914, 1941) |  |
| Russia's Warm-Water Port Problem | Most Russian ports freeze in winter. Vladivostok: ice-locked 4 months. Murmansk: freezes several months. Sevastopol (Crimea): only true warm-water port. This drives Russian foreign policy |  |
| Why Russia Annexed Crimea (2014) | Sevastopol = Russia's only major warm-water port. Pro-Western Ukraine threatened Russian access. Putin could not be 'the man who lost Crimea'. West wouldn't fight over it |  |
| Buffer Zone Strategy | Russia wants friendly/neutral states between itself and NATO. Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova = buffer states. NATO expansion eastward is existential threat in Russian eyes |  |
| Russia's Energy Weapon | World's 2nd largest gas supplier. 25%+ of Europe's gas comes from Russia. Finland, Latvia, Slovakia, Estonia: 100% dependent. Can turn off taps to influence foreign policy |  |
| Novorossiya - Putin's Hint | 2014: Putin revived term 'New Russia' for southern/eastern Ukraine. Territory Catherine the Great won from Ottomans. Signal that Russia may want these regions back |  |
| Why Russia Invaded Afghanistan (1979) | Not about Communism. About warm-water port: route to Indian Ocean via Gwadar. 'Wash boots in warm waters' = centuries-old Russian dream |  |
| Ethnic Russians Abroad | Millions of ethnic Russians live in former USSR states. Russia's law: must 'protect ethnic Russians'. Definition is flexible - useful pretext for intervention (Crimea, Donbas) |  |
| Choke Point | Strategic narrow passage (strait, canal) that controls shipping. Examples: Strait of Malacca, Suez Canal, Strait of Hormuz. Can be blocked to cripple economies |  |
| Buffer Zone | Territory between two rival powers. Provides defensive depth. Examples: Ukraine for Russia, Afghanistan for Pakistan, Tibet for China. Often fought over |  |
| Blue Water Navy | Navy capable of operating globally across open oceans. Only US has true Blue Water Navy. China building one. Requires aircraft carriers, global bases, logistics |  |
| Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) | 200 nautical miles from coast where country has exclusive rights to fishing, oil, minerals. Can extend to 350 miles. Basis for most maritime disputes |  |
| Strategic Depth | Geographic space to retreat and regroup if invaded. Russia has it (vast territory). Pakistan lacks it (Islamabad 250 miles from India). Drives foreign policy |  |
| Arctic Ocean - Size | 5.4 million square miles. World's smallest ocean but almost as big as Russia. Melting ice is opening new shipping routes and resource access |  |
| Northwest Passage | Sea route through Canadian Arctic archipelago. Connects Atlantic to Pacific. Now ice-free several weeks/year. Saves 40% vs Panama Canal (Europe→China) |  |
| Northern Sea Route | Russian Arctic route along Siberian coast. Open several months/year now. Russia controls it. Alternative to Suez Canal for Asia-Europe trade |  |
| Russia's Icebreaker Fleet | 40+ icebreakers including 7 nuclear-powered (only country with nuclear icebreakers). More than all other countries combined. USA has 1 functioning heavy icebreaker |  |
| Arctic Council | 8 member states: Russia, USA, Canada, Norway, Denmark (Greenland), Iceland, Finland, Sweden. Forum for Arctic governance. China has observer status |  |
| UNCLOS | UN Convention on Law of the Sea. Gives countries 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Can extend to 350 miles with continental shelf proof. USA hasn't ratified it\! |  |
| Arctic Resources | Estimated 90 billion barrels of oil, 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Mostly offshore. Accessible as ice melts. Worth trillions |  |
| Russia's Arctic Claim | Planted titanium flag on seabed at North Pole (2007). Claims Lomonosov Ridge extends from Siberia to Pole. Building 6 new Arctic military bases |  |
| Svalbard Islands | Northernmost inhabited place on Earth. Norwegian sovereignty but Russia has coal mining community there. Potential flashpoint. Russia could claim 'protecting citizens' |  |
| Albedo Effect | Dark land/water absorbs more heat than white ice/snow. As ice melts, more dark surface exposed → absorbs more heat → melts more ice. Self-accelerating cycle |  |
| Indus River - Strategic Importance | Originates in Tibet, flows through Indian-controlled Kashmir, then through entire Pakistan. 2/3 of Pakistan depends on it. Control of Kashmir = control of water |  |
| Baluchistan | 45% of Pakistan's land area but tiny population. Rich in gas and minerals. Independence movement. Key: Gwadar Port (China). Pakistan will never let it go |  |
| India-China Border | 1,652 miles along Himalayas. 1962 war (China won). Disputes over Arunachal Pradesh ('South Tibet'). Mountains prevent major conflict but tension remains |  |
| Why Himalayas Matter | Natural wall between world's two most populous countries. Prevents large-scale military invasion. China took Tibet partly to control these heights |  |
| Abbottabad (2011) | Pakistani military garrison town where US found and killed Osama bin Laden. Proved Pakistan's 'double game'. US didn't tell Pakistan in advance - trust was gone |  |
| India - Key Facts | Population: 1.4B. GDP: $4.1T (#5 world). GDP/capita: $2,937 (122nd world). World's largest democracy. Nuclear power. Rival to both Pakistan AND China |  |
| Pakistan - Key Facts | Population: 255M. GDP: $340B. GDP/capita: $1,212 (134th world). Nuclear armed. Fragile state: 5 ethnic groups (Punjab 60%, Sindh, Pashtun, Baluchi, Kashmiri). Defined by opposition to India |  |
| PAKISTAN Acronym | P=Punjab, A=Afghania (Pashtun), K=Kashmir, S=Sindh, TAN=Baluchistan. 5 distinct peoples, one fragile state. 'Pak' means 'pure' in Urdu |  |
| Partition of 1947 | British left India in 73 days. 1 million dead. 15 million displaced. Created India (Hindu) and Pakistan (Muslim). Rushed, chaotic, violent |  |
| Kashmir Conflict | Divided between India and Pakistan. Both claim all of it. 4 wars fought. Both sides nuclear-armed. 'Asia's Berlin Wall' = Line of Control |  |
| Line of Control | De facto border in Kashmir. Not recognized as international border by either side. Heavily militarized. Regular skirmishes. Could trigger nuclear war |  |
| ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) | Pakistan's spy agency. Created Taliban. Played double game with USA. Helped bin Laden hide. Controls much of Pakistan's foreign policy |  |
| Durand Line (1893) | Border between Afghanistan and Pakistan drawn by British. Divides Pashtun people. Afghanistan never recognized it. Taliban operates across it freely |  |
| Why Pakistan Needs Afghanistan | Strategic depth - place to retreat if India invades. Only 250 miles from Indian border to Islamabad (flat terrain). Afghanistan = insurance policy |  |
| Taliban - Origin | Created by Pakistani ISI in 1990s. Pashtun ethnic base. Took over Afghanistan. Hosted Al Qaeda. After 9/11: US attacked, Taliban waited them out |  |
| Germany - Key Facts | Population: 84M. GDP: $4.9T (#1 Europe, #3 world). GDP/capita: $57,914 (18th world). 23.7% of EU GDP. World's 3rd largest exporter. 'Made in Germany' replaced armies with goods |  |
| France - Key Facts | Population: 68M. GDP: $3.4T (#3 Europe). GDP/capita: $49,527 (23rd world). Only country that is both Northern AND Southern European power. Nuclear deterrent ('Force de frappe'). Largest agricultural land in Western Europe |  |
| UK - Key Facts | Population: 68M. GDP: $3.7T (#2 Europe). GDP/capita: $54,280 (21st world). Island geography = protection + global naval power. Controls GIUK Gap (choke point to Atlantic). 'Splendid isolation' from continent |  |
| The German Question | Historical fear: Germany surrounded by France (west) and Russia (east). Solution after WW2: Lock Germany into NATO/EU so tightly it can't punch anyone |  |
| North European Plain | Flat corridor from France to Urals. Germany's weakness: no mountains to defend. Russia's weakness: can be invaded through it. Explains WW1, WW2, Cold War |  |
| GIUK Gap | Greenland-Iceland-UK. Choke point for Russian navy reaching Atlantic. Called 'Kill Zone' by NATO during Cold War. UK's strategic advantage |  |
| Why Europe Developed First | 1) Gulf Stream = mild climate, year-round farming 2) Navigable rivers (Rhine, Danube) 3) Natural harbors 4) No major deserts or jungles |  |
| EU North-South Divide | North (Germany, Netherlands): Industrial, Protestant, fiscally conservative. South (Greece, Spain, Italy): Agricultural, Catholic, more debt. Caused Euro crisis tensions |  |
| Euro Crisis Explained | Southern countries joined Euro before being ready. 2008 crash exposed this. Germany had to bail out Greece. Created 'austerity vs sovereignty' conflict |  |
| Poland's Geography Problem | On the North European Plain between Germany and Russia. Invaded repeatedly. Border changed constantly. Now in NATO as protection against Russia |  |
| China - Key Facts | Population: 1.4B. GDP: $19.4T (#2 world). GDP/capita: $13,873 (68th world). World's largest exporter. Building Blue Water Navy to challenge US dominance |  |
| First Island Chain | Japan → Taiwan → Philippines. Blocks China's access to Pacific. China must control or bypass these islands for global naval power |  |
| Tibet - Why China Needs It | 1) Buffer against India 2) 'China's Water Tower' - source of Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong rivers 3) High ground advantage 4) China will never let go |  |
| Xinjiang | China's largest province (2x Texas). Muslim Uighur population. Borders 8 countries. Home to nuclear test sites. Independence movement suppressed. Han settlement ongoing |  |
| Strait of Malacca - China's Vulnerability | Only 2 miles wide at narrowest point. 80% of China's energy imports pass through. Could be blocked by US Navy → why China builds alternative routes |  |
| Nine Dash Line | China's claim to almost entire South China Sea. Disputed by Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan. No legal basis but backed by military |  |
| Han Chinese | 90%+ of China's population. Dominate politics and business. Settling in Tibet and Xinjiang to cement control. Policy: demographic conquest |  |
| South China Sea Disputes | China vs 6 countries over 200+ tiny islands. Stakes: fishing, oil/gas, shipping lanes. China building artificial islands with military bases |  |
| China's Grand Bargain | Deal with population: 'We make you richer, you follow our orders.' If economy crashes → mass unemployment → social unrest → threat to Communist Party |  |
| Gwadar Port (Pakistan) | Deep-water port China built on Arabian Sea. Bypasses Strait of Malacca for energy imports. Part of $46B China-Pakistan Economic Corridor |  |
| Sahel - Definition | Arabic for 'coast' - the 3,000-mile semi-arid strip south of the Sahara. Marks the boundary between Islamic North Africa and Christian/Animist sub-Saharan Africa |  |
| Scramble for Africa (1884-1885) | Berlin Conference where Europeans divided Africa among themselves. Drew borders ignoring ethnic groups → root cause of many modern conflicts |  |
| Africa's True Size | 3x larger than the USA\! Mercator maps distort it. Could fit USA + China + India + all of Western Europe inside with room to spare |  |
| Why Africa 'underdeveloped'? | 1) No natural harbors 2) Rivers have waterfalls (not navigable) 3) Sahara isolated the south 4) Malaria & Tsetse fly blocked European penetration inland |  |
| Suez Canal - Importance | Saves 6,000 miles vs going around Cape of Good Hope. 8% of world trade passes through daily. 2.5% of world's oil daily. Opened 1869 |  |
| Boko Haram | Islamist group in northeast Nigeria (ethnic Kanuri). Wants to establish caliphate. 2014: kidnapped 276 schoolgirls. Operates from Mandara mountains near Cameroon border |  |
| Rwanda Genocide (1994) | 800,000 Tutsi killed by Hutu militias (Interahamwe) in ~100 days. Survivors fled to DRC → triggered 'Africa's World War' |  |
| Africa's World War (1990s-2000s) | DRC conflict involving 9 neighboring countries. 6 million dead. Largest conflict since WW2. Barely covered by Western media |  |
| China in Africa - Strategy | Wants: Oil (Angola, Sudan), minerals (DRC: cobalt, copper). Offers: Infrastructure (ports, railways). Doesn't ask about human rights - attractive to dictators |  |
| Artificial Borders - Example: Nigeria | 250+ ethnic groups forced into one state by British. No shared identity. North-South religious divide. Recipe for conflict |  |
| Nigeria - Key Facts | Population: 230M (largest in Africa). GDP: $253B. GDP/capita: $835 (145th world). Main export: Oil (in the south). Key problem: North-South divide (Muslim/poor vs Christian/oil-rich) |  |
| South Africa - Key Facts | Population: 60M. GDP: $400B (#1 Africa). GDP/capita: $6,517 (90th world). Only African country without malaria (elevation) → enabled early European settlement. Dominates southern Africa economically & militarily |  |
| Egypt - Key Facts | Population: 116M. GDP: $350B. GDP/capita: $3,160 (117th world). 98% live along the Nile! Most powerful Arab military. Controls Suez Canal (8% of world trade daily). Conflict risk: Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam threatens Nile water supply |  |
| Ethiopia - Key Facts | Population: 130M. GDP: $192B. GDP/capita: $1,108 (137th world). Called 'Africa's Water Tower' - source of Blue Nile. Building Grand Renaissance Dam → potential war with Egypt over water |  |
| DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) | Population: 105M. GDP: $78B. GDP/capita: $744 (171st world). Size: Larger than Germany+France+Spain. 200+ ethnic groups. 6M dead since 1990s wars. Enormous mineral wealth but zero development |  |
| Angola - Key Facts | Population: 36M. GDP: $117B. GDP/capita: $2,991 (120th world). #2 oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa. 50%+ exports go to China. Civil war 1975-2002 (Cold War proxy) |  |
| Kenya - Key Facts | Population: 56M. GDP: $122B. GDP/capita: $2,187 (127th world). East Africa's economic hub. 'Silicon Savannah' tech hub. China built $4B rail Mombasa→Nairobi |  |
| Tanzania - Key Facts | Population: 67M. GDP: $85B. GDP/capita: $1,272 (133rd world). Building Bagamoyo port with China (will be Africa's largest). Member of East African Community & Southern African Development Community |  |
| Algeria - Key Facts | Population: 46M. GDP: $258B (#3 Africa). GDP/capita: $5,593 (101st world). Largest African country by area. Major natural gas exporter to Europe. Independence war vs France (1954-62) |  |
